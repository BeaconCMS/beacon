# Release Process

## Guidelines

* Follow Semantic Versioning
* Each project has its own lifecycle and releases, one may evolve faster than others
* A release once a month on every first Wednesday of the month including all merged work since last release,
  unless there's no substantial changes to justify a release  (this policy will be valid only after v0.1 is released)
* Breaking changes can be released as a minor version before we reach a v1.0 release
* Bug fixes and security patches may be released early as needed

## Process

Issues tagged as [roadmap](https://github.com/BeaconCMS/beacon/labels/roadmap) indicate the work that is planned to be worked
next on the short term, those have more priority over the other issues and will be included in the next releases. We don't
guarantee which exact issues will be included in the very next release but we may give more priority to specific issues as
decided by the core team as needed.
