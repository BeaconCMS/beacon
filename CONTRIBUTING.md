# How to Contribute

## Issue Tags

The tag [good first issue](https://github.com/BeaconCMS/beacon/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) is recommended for fist time contributors, they are usually small fixes or improvements that don't require too much knowledge of the project. The tag [help wanted](https://github.com/BeaconCMS/beacon/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+-label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+) represents issues that would benefit from contributors but may need more knowledge or discussion over the requirements.

## Improve documentation

We are always looking to improve our documentation. If at some moment you are
reading the documentation and something is not clear, or you can't find what you
are looking for, then please open an issue with the repository. This gives us a
chance to answer your question and to improve the documentation if needed.

Pull requests correcting spelling or grammar mistakes are always welcome.

## Found a bug?

Please try to answer at least the following questions when reporting a bug:

 - Which version of the project did you use when you noticed the bug?
 - How do you reproduce the error condition?
 - What happened that you think is a bug?
 - What should it do instead?

It would really help the maintainers if you could provide a reduced test case
that reproduces the error condition.
