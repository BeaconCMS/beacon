# Contributing to Beacon

## Guidelines

* Issues aligned with our [roadmap](https://github.com/BeaconCMS/beacon_live_admin/blob/main/ROADMAP.md) have higher priority
  and those are [labeled as roadmap](https://github.com/BeaconCMS/beacon/labels/roadmap)
* [Bugs](https://github.com/BeaconCMS/beacon/labels/bug) tend to have higher priority unless they are of minor impact
* If unsure where to start, look for issues tagged as [good first issue](https://github.com/BeaconCMS/beacon/labels/good%20first%20issue) to find good candidates for your first contribution
* Issues tagged [help wanted](https://github.com/BeaconCMS/beacon/labels/help%20wanted) are also good candidates but may require more project knowledge and/or time investment
* Issues are usually tagged by type and area to help identify their priority aligned to our roadmap

## Improve documentation

We are always looking to improve our documentation. If at some moment you are
reading the documentation and something is not clear, or you can't find what you
are looking for, then please open an issue with the repository. This gives us a
chance to answer your question and to improve the documentation if needed.

Pull requests correcting spelling or grammar mistakes are always welcome.

## Found a bug?

Please open a [bug report](https://github.com/BeaconCMS/beacon/issues/new?template=bug_report.md&labes=bug).

## Have a feature request?

Please open a [feature request](https://github.com/BeaconCMS/beacon/issues/new?template=feature_request.md&labes=feature-request).

## Submitting a pull-request?

Here are some things that will increase the chance that your pull-request will
get accepted:
 - Did you confirm this fix/feature is something that is needed?
 - Did you write tests, preferably in a test driven style?
 - Did you add documentation for the changes you made?

If your pull-request addresses an issue then please add the corresponding
issue's number to the description of your pull-request.

## Prioritization

Issues tagged as [roadmap](https://github.com/BeaconCMS/beacon/labels/roadmap) indicate the work that is planned to be done
next in the short term. Those have more priority over the other issues and will be included in the next releases.

Engaging on [feature request issues](https://github.com/BeaconCMS/beacon/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afeature-request) also helps us to prioritize the work,
so feel free to add comments or discuss on feature requests you'd like to see implemented and those will have more priority over the other issues.

Finally keep in mind that we can't guarantee which exact issues will be included in the very next release and we may give more
priority to specific issues as decided by the core team as needed.
