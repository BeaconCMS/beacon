# Heroicons

[Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/) is a popular icon library added by default in new Phoenix applications and also available in Beacon as a component.

The component `heroicon` is added by default in new Beacon sites without extra configuration to let you render icons in your pages:

```heex
<.heroicon name="light-bulb" solid />
```

In this example, the `light-bulb` icon is rendered in solid style, which is provided by the [Heroicons](https://hex.pm/packages/heroicons) package.
