# Heroicons

[Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/) is a popular icon library added by default in new Phoenix applications and also available in Beacon as a component.

The component `heroicon` is added by default in new Beacon sites without extra configuration to let you render icons in your pages.

For example, to render a `light-bulb` icon in the solid style:

```heex
<.heroicon name="light-bulb" solid />
```
