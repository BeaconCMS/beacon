# Upgrading to v0.1.0

## Bump your deps

Update Beacon to v0.1.x

```elixir
[
  {:beacon, "~> 0.1.0"}
]
```

Note that a more relaxed version like `~> 0.1`  or `>= 0.0.0` would install the version `1.1.0` which is not the Beacon CSM project,
ie: you have to install a version that is less than `1.0.0`.

Remember to keep the option `override: true` if running BeaconLiveAdmin in the same project.

## Update sites config

Replace the option `:skip_boot?` with `:mode` if you were using it (most sites don't need to set this option).

## Update Elixir version

Beacon v0.1.0 requires Elixir 1.14.0 or later, please update your tools if necessary.

## Update mdex version (only if using `:mdex` directly)

Update `:mdex` to `~> 0.2` in your `mix.exs` file, and replace any calls to `MDEx.to_html` with `MDEx.to_html/1`.
