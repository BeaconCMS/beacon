# Upgrading from pre v0.1.0 to v0.1.0-rc.0

This guide applies to instances of Beacon that started before the v0.1.0-rc.0 release,
and need to migrate data and make changes to update to the latest version.

For this guide, we'll assume your Beacon dependency is set to [1d8d2fd636a40c107d47d0a87869930fdd0f82d0](https://github.com/BeaconCMS/beacon/tree/1d8d2fd636a40c107d47d0a87869930fdd0f82d0)
from Oct 11, 2023, but it should apply to any revision.

## Migrate the database schema and data

Before v0.1.0-rc.0 we used to keep the list of migrations in the `priv/repo/migrations` directly,
but eventually we merged all those files into a single migration for the v0.1.0-rc.0 release.
So before we can bump Beacon to the latest version, we need to execute the remaining migrations up to v0.1.0-rc.0

You can see the  migrations in https://github.com/BeaconCMS/beacon/tree/c87777d8559378502188a19a696ac465e1618424/priv/repo/migrations

Open the file `mix.exs` and update the Beacon dependency to the specific revision along with the other required dependencies:

```elixir
[
  {:beacon, github: "BeaconCMS/beacon", ref: "c87777d8559378502188a19a696ac465e1618424", override: true},
  {:beacon_live_admin, github: "BeaconCMS/beacon", ref: "9e31e0e307cf5ad44be50c689a472905c976bff3"},
  {:phoenix_html, "~> 4.0"},
  {:phoenix_live_view, "~> 0.20"},
]
```

Now execute `mix deps.update --all` to resolve all conflicts.

Before executing the migrations, we need to fix the breaking changes.

## Phoenix HTML

Phoenix HTML 4.0 has introduced breaking changes, so make sure to follow [these instructions ](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_html/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v400-2023-12-19)
to fix your application.

## beacon_api

The macro `beacon_api` has been removed. Open the file `router.ex` and remove any call to that macro.

## Site config for c87777d8559378502188a19a696ac465e1618424

This version requires the fields `:endpoint` and `:router` besides the `:site` field,
so edit your site(s) configuration, usually in the file `application.ex` to add those fields if not present.

```elixir
{Beacon,
 sites: [
   [
     site: :my_site,
     endpoint: BeaconDemoWeb.Endpoint,
     router: BeaconDemoWeb.Router
   ]
 ]},
```

## Check for errors

Execute `mix compile --all-warnings` and check for errors and warnings, other than the missing `Beacon.DataSource.Behaviour` module.

It should compile without errors and with no extra warnings, otherwise, fix them before proceeding.

## Execute the migrations

Execute `mix ecto.migrate` to run the remaining migrations.

## Bump Beacon to latest version

Replace both `:beacon` and `:beacon_live_admin` to use the latest version, which at this moment is in the `0.1.x` series.

```elixir
[
  {:beacon, "~> 0.1.0"},
  {:beacon_live_admin, "~> 0.1.0"},
]
```

Now execute `mix deps.update --all` to resolve all conflicts.

## Site config for v0.1

TODO: igniter


## Beacon.DataSource.Behaviour

That module has been removed if favor of LiveData, which is also a way to define data for pages but at runtime
instead of compile time. There's no automatic migration for this data, so you'll need to access the Live Data page
in the admin interface and recreate the data there.
