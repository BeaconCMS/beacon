# Upgrading to v0.1.0-rc.2

## Bump your deps

Update Beacon to the specific release candidate version:

```elixir
[
  {:beacon, "~> 0.1.0-rc.2"}
]
```

Remember to keep the option `override: true` if running BeaconLiveAdmin in the same project.

## Update Gettext

[Gettext](https://hex.pm/packages/gettext) has been updated to `~> 0.26` which requires a change,
but fortunately it's a small and beneficial one.

In your `mix.exs` file, update the `:gettext` dependency to at least `~> 0.26`:

```elixir
[
  {:gettext, "~> 0.26"}
]
```

Then change your application's `Gettext` module to use the new `Gettext.Backend` module:

```elixir
defmodule MyAppWeb.Gettext do
  use Gettext.Backend, otp_app: :my_app_web
end
```

_Change the names accordingly, the only change needed here is adding the `.Backend` suffix._

And now in every place you used to `import MyAppWeb.Gettext`, just replace with `use Gettext, backend: MyAppWeb.Gettext`
