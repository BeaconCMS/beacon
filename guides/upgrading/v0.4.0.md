# Upgrading to v0.4.0

## Update Beacon tables

Beacon v0.4 requires some new database tables for the latest features.  To create these tables,
simply run the generator for a new Ecto Migration module:

```sh
mix ecto.gen.migration update_beacon_v003
```

Then, within the generated module, call Beacon's migration helpers:

```elixir
use Ecto.Migration
def up, do: Beacon.Migration.up()
def down, do: Beacon.Migration.down()
```

## Move `Beacon` before the endpoint in application.ex

Open the file `application.ex`, find the Beacon tuple in the list of `children`,
and move it to before the endpoint(s) declarations:

```elixir
@impl true
def start(_type, _args) do
  children = [
    # ...
    {Beacon, [sites: [Application.fetch_env!(:beacon, :my_site)]]}, # <- moved to before `MyAppWeb.Endpoint`
    MyAppWeb.Endpoint
  ]
```

In v0.3.0 the order was inverted which caused a regression on crash recoveries.

## Copy the `esbuild` binary in the release

The binary `esbuild` is now required at runtime to bundle JS hooks,
so it should be available in the release package.

Follow these instructions to update your project:

1. Update `copy_beacon_files/1` function in `mix.exs`

That function is responsible for checking and copying the binary files 
into the right place. See the [Deploy to Fly.io](https://hexdocs.pm/beacon/deploy-to-flyio.html)
guides to copy the actual code and paste into your project `mix.exs` file.

2. Update `Dockerfile`

In order to make sure both `tailwind` and `esbuild` are available you should include
these lines before `RUN mix release`:

```dockerfile
RUN mix tailwind.install --no-assets --if-missing
RUN mix esbuild.install --if-missing
```

More info in the [Deploy to Fly.io](https://hexdocs.pm/beacon/deploy-to-flyio.html) guide.
