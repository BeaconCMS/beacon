# Upgrading to v0.4.0

## Move `Beacon` before the endpoint in application.ex

Open the file `application.ex`, find the Beacon tuple in the list of `children`,
and move it to before the endpoint(s) declarations:

```elixir
@impl true
def start(_type, _args) do
  children = [
    # ...
    {Beacon, [sites: [Application.fetch_env!(:beacon, :my_site)]]}, # <- moved to before `MyAppWeb.Endpoint`
    MyAppWeb.Endpoint
  ]
```

In v0.3.0 the order was inverted which caused a regression on crash recoveries.
