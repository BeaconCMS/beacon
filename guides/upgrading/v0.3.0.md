# Upgrading to v0.3.0

## Move `Beacon` after the endpoint in application.ex

Beacon needs to access each site's endpoint info in order to boot the sites,
so those endpoints must be started before the `Beacon` supervisor.

Open the file `application.ex`, find the Beacon tuple in the list of `children`,
and move it to after the endpoint(s) declarations, usually at the end of that list:

```elixir
@impl true
def start(_type, _args) do
  children = [
    # ...
    MyAppWeb.Endpoint,
    {Beacon, [sites: [Application.fetch_env!(:beacon, :my_site)]]} # <- moved to after `MyAppWeb.Endpoint`
  ]
```

## Add `Beacon.Plug` to your Router

In your application's `router.ex` file, first find where your sites are defined:

```elixir
scope "/", MyAppWeb do
  pipe_through :browser
  beacon_site "/", site: :my_site
end
```

In the above case we can see the site `:my_site` is inside a scope piped through `:browser`,
so let's add a new `:beacon` pipeline with the `Beacon.Plug`:

```elixir
pipeline :beacon do
  plug Beacon.Plug
end
```

And add that pipeline into the existing scope:

```elixir
scope "/", MyAppWeb do
  pipe_through [:browser, :beacon] # <- add the pipeline here
  beacon_site "/", site: :my_site
end
```

Now the `Beacon.Plug` will ensure consistent rendering, particularly important when Page Variants are used.
