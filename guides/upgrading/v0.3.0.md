# Upgrading to v0.3.0

## Add `Beacon.Plug` to your Router

In your application's `router.ex`, first find the pipeline used for your beacon_site.  It is usually `:browser` but you can check:

```elixir
scope "/" do
  pipe_through :browser
  beacon_site "/", site: :my_site
end
```

In the above case we can see the pipeline is `:browser`.  Still in the router, look for that pipeline and add `plug Beacon.Plug`:

```elixir
pipeline :browser do
  ...
  plug Beacon.Plug
end
```

Now the `Beacon.Plug` will ensure consistent rendering, particularly important when Page Variants are used.
