# Your First Site

## Pre-requisites

To get your first site up and running, you first need a working Phoenix application with Phoenix LiveView and also the Beacon LiveAdmin to create and manage resources for your site.

You need to follow the two guides below to get started:

- [Install Beacon](https://github.com/BeaconCMS/beacon/blob/main/guides/installation.md)
- [Install Beacon LiveAdmin](https://github.com/BeaconCMS/beacon_live_admin/blob/main/guides/installation.md)

Beacon can be installed on existing Phoenix applications, but make sure the minimum requirements are met as described in the installation guide.

## Generating the site

Each site requires some minimal configuratin to run, lets use the built-in `beacon.install` generator to get started quickly. In the root of your application, execute:

```
mix beacon.install --site my_site
```

You can use other name you like as long as you remember to change it in the following steps.

## Configuring the routes

In the `router.ex` file,  you'll see the following scope in a new Phoenix application:

```elixir
scope "/", MyAppWeb do
  pipe_through :browser

  get "/", PageController, :home
end
```

Or something similar if you have changed it before. For this tutorial we are assuming the Beacon site will be mounted at the root `/` route,
so you can delete that block or change where the Beacon site is mounted, as long as you keep that in mind and adjust accordingly throughout the tutorial.

And finally change the generated scope created by Beacon to look like:

```elixir
scope "/" do
  pipe_through :browser
  beacon_site "/", site: :my_site
end
```

With this change the site will be served at [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/)

## Connecting to a database

The `beacon.install` generator will change and create some files for you but the most important configuration at this point is adjusting the Repo credentials since Beacon requires a database to save layouts, pages, and all the site data.

Look for the config `config :beacon, Beacon.Repo` in the files `config/dev.exs` and `config/prod.exs` to make the database configuration looks correct to your environment.

## Acessing LiveAdmin to manage your site

We're done with configuration so far, let's run the project and access the LiveAdmin UI.

Firstly execute the following to install dependencies:

```sh
mix setup
```

And now start your Phoenix app:

```sh
mix phx.server
```

Visit http://localhost:4000/admin and you should see the `my_site` that you just created listed on the admin interface.

Now let's create the resources for our first site.

## Creating the home page

Go to http://localhost:4000/admin/my_site/pages and you should see a page already created for the `/` path. We're going to change it.

Edit the template to replace with this content:

Save the changes and Publish the page. Go to http://localhost:4000 and you'll see an error! That's because we haven't created all resources used in that page yet. Let's fix it.

## Live Data

The current year is displayed at the footer as an assign `<%= @current_year %>` so we need to create such assign for our page.

Go to http://localhost:4000/admin/my_site/live_data to create a new path `/` and then create a new assign named `current_year` with the following value:

```elixir
Date.utc_today().year
```

Remember to change the Format to Elixir so that content can be evaluated as Elixir code.

Go to the home page again and refresh the page, it should render and you should see the current year displayed at the footer. But trying to submit the form to signup to the newsletter does nothing
and you can see on the console logs of your Phoenix server that Beacon tries to handle that event but it doesn't find any handler for it. Let's fix that.

## Event Handler

Edit the home page and click on the Events tab. There we'll create a new event handler for the form submission `join` defined in our home page template.

The name used in the template must match so create a new Event Handler named `join` with the following content:


```elixir
%{"waitlist" => %{"email" => email}} = event_params
IO.puts("#{email} joined the waitlist")
{:noreply, assign(socket, :joined, true)}
```

As you can see submiting the form will log the email to the console and set the `joined` assign to `true`, which is used to display a message to the user that the email was successfully submitted.
Let's see it working. Publish the page again and go back to the home page, fill the form and submit it.

Congratulations! You have a site up and running. The next step is to [deploy your site](https://github.com/BeaconCMS/beacon/blob/main/guides/recipes/deploy-to-flyio.md).
